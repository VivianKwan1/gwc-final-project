            This playlist is a glorious dialogue between two bands. Jet is swooning over Wet, but Wet is dismissive and rejects Jet. However, if you loop the playlist, you can truly feel the push and pull of each band's emotions building up on each repetition. With contrasting music genres and tone, the deep emotional turmoil between Jet and Wet is indicative of the trend in romance music and movies of the chase and the drama throughout a love story.
